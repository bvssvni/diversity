Diversity is an efficient syntax for a large variety of calculations on lists.

- Backward compatible with basic arithmetic:

	1 + 2 = 3
	[1,2] ++ [1,0] = [2,2]

- Natural scalar interaction and summation:

	[1,2] * 3 = (1*3) + (2*3) = 3 + 6 = 9

- Lot of features, including Partition numbers:

	8@2			Number of ways to divide 8 items by 2 people.
	8@1:8		Partition of 8, number of ways to write 8 as sum.
